# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Problem Statement

Employee attrition, the phenomenon of employees voluntarily or involuntarily leaving an organization, is a critical challenge for businesses. High attrition rates can lead to:

- **Increased operational costs** (e.g., recruitment, training, and lost productivity).
- **Disruption in team dynamics** and project continuity.
- **Loss of institutional knowledge** and expertise.

### The Challenge
Organizations often struggle to identify employees at risk of leaving until itâ€™s too late. Traditional methods of attrition analysis are reactive and fail to address root causes such as:
- Job dissatisfaction
- Lack of career growth
- Poor work-life balance
- Inadequate compensation
- Managerial issues

### Objective
This project aims to **predict employee attrition proactively** using machine learning. By analyzing historical employee data, the model identifies patterns and risk factors associated with attrition, enabling organizations to:
- **Intervene early** with retention strategies (e.g., promotions, salary adjustments, or mentorship programs).
- **Reduce turnover costs** and maintain workforce stability.
- **Improve employee satisfaction** by addressing systemic issues.

## Dataset
The dataset (`HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`) includes **35 features** for **1,470 employees**, such as:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status
- **Job-related**: Department, Job Role, Monthly Income, Years at Company
- **Behavioral**: Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Overtime, Training Frequency

**Target Variable**: `Attrition` (binary: `Yes`/`No` indicating whether the employee left).

---

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and correlations between features and attrition.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle categorical variables (one-hot encoding) and scale numerical features.
3. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost).
4. **Insights**: Identify key drivers of attrition and recommend actionable strategies.

## Key Results
- The **AdaBoost Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy (88%) in predicting attrition.
